# Gamer's Paradise

## Description

Have you ever wanted a place where you could connect with other people who enjoy the same things as you? If you enjoy playing video games, then Gamer's Paradise is for you! 
Our team is a group of people who all enjoy playing games, so we came up with the idea of a social blog where people can connect over their favorite games. 
The idea is to setup a profile with your own information, such as your username, and the games you're interested in, and then you can post on the feed about whatever you please!
Throughout the creation of this project, all of us learned a lot more about setting up both the frontend and backend of a webpage, while also getting more experience working in a group on github.
